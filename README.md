# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Executive Summary  
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the banking industry, directly affecting revenue and profitability. This project analyzes a retail bank’s customer data to uncover churn drivers, highlight key performance indicators, and provide actionable insights for improving customer retention.  

The analysis was conducted in **Excel**, showcasing how raw customer data can be transformed into executive-level insights and an interactive dashboard to support strategic decision-making.  

---
## Business Objectives  
- Measure **churn and retention rates** across the customer base.  
- Profile **churned vs. retained customers** using demographics and satisfaction data.  
- Identify **key churn drivers** such as satisfaction, tenure, and age.  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** to support real-time business decisions.  

---

## Key Insights  
From a dataset of **10,000 customers**:  
- **Retention Rate**: 79.6% (7,962 customers retained).  
- **Churn Rate**: 20.4% (2,038 customers churned).  
- **Satisfaction Score**: Average of 3.0/5 — lower scores strongly correlate with churn.  
- **Customer Tenure**: Average of 5 years — longer-tenured customers are more loyal.  
- **Demographics**: Younger customers (average age ~39) churn more frequently than older cohorts.  

 **Strategic Implications**  
- Improving customer satisfaction even slightly could materially reduce churn.  
- Early-tenure and younger customers should be prioritized for **retention campaigns**.  
- **Loyalty programs and proactive engagement** can help strengthen long-term retention.
