## Key Insights  
From a dataset of **10,000 customers**:  
- **Retention Rate**: 79.6% (7,962 customers retained).  
- **Churn Rate**: 20.4% (2,038 customers churned).  
- **Satisfaction Score**: Average of 3.0/5 — lower scores strongly correlate with churn.  
- **Customer Tenure**: Average of 5 years — longer-tenured customers are more loyal.  
- **Demographics**: Younger customers (average age ~39) churn more frequently than older cohorts.  

 **Strategic Implications**  
- Improving customer satisfaction even slightly could materially reduce churn.  
- Early-tenure and younger customers should be prioritized for **retention campaigns**.  
- **Loyalty programs and proactive engagement** can help strengthen long-term retention.
